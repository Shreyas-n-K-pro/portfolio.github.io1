    <h1>Space and Time Efficiency</h1>

    <h2>Time Efficiency</h2>
    <p>Time Efficiency is about how fast an algorithm runs. Imagine you‚Äôre baking a cake‚Äîtime efficiency is how quickly you can finish baking.</p>

    <h2>Space Efficiency</h2>
    <p>Space Efficiency is about how much memory or storage an algorithm uses while running. It‚Äôs like how many bowls or tools you need to bake that cake. The fewer, the better.</p>

    <h2>Why Are They Important?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Save Time: Faster algorithms mean less waiting.</li>
      <li>Save Memory: Efficient algorithms don‚Äôt use too much computer memory, so your device won‚Äôt slow down or crash.</li>
      <li>Handle Bigger Problems: Efficient algorithms can process large amounts of data without issues.</li>
      <li>Better User Experience: Nobody likes apps or websites that are slow and laggy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of Problems</h2>
    <h3>Easy Problems (P)</h3>
    <p>Problems that computers can solve quickly. For example, sorting a list of names or finding the shortest path on a map.</p>

    <h3>Tricky Problems (NP)</h3>
    <p>Harder to solve but easy to check, like solving a jigsaw puzzle.</p>

    <h3>Super Tricky Problems (NP-Complete)</h3>
    <p>The hardest puzzles. If we figure out a fast way to solve one of them, we can solve many other tricky problems just as fast.</p>

    <h3>Impossible Problems (NP-Hard)</h3>
    <p>Problems so tough that no one knows how to solve them efficiently‚Äîor even check the answer easily in some cases.</p>

    <h2>Orders of Growth</h2>
    <h3>O(1) ‚Äì Constant Time</h3>
    <p>No matter the size, it always takes the same time. Example: Picking the first book from a pile.</p>

    <h3>O(log n) ‚Äì Logarithmic Time</h3>
    <p>Grows slowly as input increases. Example: Finding a name in a phone book (binary search).</p>

    <h3>O(n) ‚Äì Linear Time</h3>
    <p>Time grows directly with input size. Example: Reading all the books in a stack one by one.</p>

    <h3>O(n log n) ‚Äì Linearithmic Time</h3>
    <p>Grows a bit faster, often seen in efficient sorting methods. Example: Sorting your books by size.</p>

    <h3>O(n¬≤) ‚Äì Quadratic Time</h3>
    <p>Time grows really fast, usually when there are nested loops. Example: Comparing every book with every other book.</p>

    <h3>O(2‚Åø) ‚Äì Exponential Time</h3>
    <p>Time doubles with each new piece of data. Example: Trying every possible combination of books to find the best arrangement.</p>

    <h3>O(n!) ‚Äì Factorial Time</h3>
    <p>Time explodes! Example: Arranging 10 books in every possible order (10! = 3,628,800 ways).</p>
