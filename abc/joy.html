<h3>Home Page – Course Introduction</h3>
<p>Welcome to the world of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)! This course is all about learning how to organize and process data effectively to solve problems faster and smarter.</p>

<h3>What is the course about?</h3>
<p>This course teaches us how to store and manage data (data structures) and how to create step-by-step methods (algorithms) to solve different problems. It’s the foundation of computer programming and is used in almost every software and app you can think of.</p>
    <h3>What kind of data structures and algorithms have you studied?</h3>
    
  <h4>Data Structures<h4>
    <p>&bull;Arrays (like lists of items), Stacks (like a stack of plates), Queues (like a line of people), and Linked Lists (like a chain).</p>
    <p>&bull;Advanced ones like Trees (family trees) and Graphs (maps with points and connections).</p>
