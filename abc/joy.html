<h3>Home Page – Course Introduction</h3>
<p>Welcome to the world of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)! This course is all about learning how to organize and process data effectively to solve problems faster and smarter.</p>

<h3>What is the course about?</h3>
<p>This course teaches us how to store and manage data (data structures) and how to create step-by-step methods (algorithms) to solve different problems. It’s the foundation of computer programming and is used in almost every software and app you can think of.</p>
    <h3>What kind of data structures and algorithms have you studied?</h3>
    
  <p>Data Structures</p>
    <p>&bull; &nbsp; Arrays (like lists of items), Stacks (like a stack of plates), Queues (like a line of people), and Linked Lists (like a chain).</p>
    <p>&bull; &nbsp; Advanced ones like Trees (family trees) and Graphs (maps with points and connections).</p>
  <p>Algorithms</p>

  <p>&bull; &nbsp; Sorting and Searching: How to organize data (like sorting numbers) or quickly find what you need (like finding a name in a contact list).</p>
  <p>&bull; &nbsp; Pathfinding: Finding the shortest route, like Google Maps does.</p>
  <p>&bull; &nbsp; Optimization: Solving problems by making the best choices, like packing a bag with maximum items but limited space.</p>

  <h3>How do you connect the course with real time applications?<h3>
  <p>&bull; &nbsp; Search engines use algorithms to show results quickly when you search for something.</p>
  <p>&bull; &nbsp; Social media apps use graphs to recommend friends or connections.</p>
  <p>&bull; &nbsp; GPS systems use algorithms to find the shortest route to your destination.</p>
  <p>&bull; &nbsp; Even basic things like undo and redo in apps use stacks!</p>
