<h3>Home Page – Course Introduction</h3>
<p>Welcome to the world of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)! This course is all about learning how to organize and process data effectively to solve problems faster and smarter.</p>

<h3>What is the course about?</h3>
<p>This course teaches us how to store and manage data (data structures) and how to create step-by-step methods (algorithms) to solve different problems. It’s the foundation of computer programming and is used in almost every software and app you can think of.</p>
    <h3>What kind of data structures and algorithms have you studied?</h3>
    
  <p>Data Structures</p>
    <p>&bull; &nbsp; Arrays (like lists of items), Stacks (like a stack of plates), Queues (like a line of people), and Linked Lists (like a chain).</p>
    <p>&bull; &nbsp; Advanced ones like Trees (family trees) and Graphs (maps with points and connections).</p>
  <p>Algorithms</p>

  <p>&bull; &nbsp; Sorting and Searching: How to organize data (like sorting numbers) or quickly find what you need (like finding a name in a contact list).</p>
  <p>&bull; &nbsp; Pathfinding: Finding the shortest route, like Google Maps does.</p>
  <p>&bull; &nbsp; Optimization: Solving problems by making the best choices, like packing a bag with maximum items but limited space.</p>

  <h3>How do you connect the course with real time applications?</h3>
  <p>&bull; &nbsp; Search engines use algorithms to show results quickly when you search for something.</p>
  <p>&bull; &nbsp; Social media apps use graphs to recommend friends or connections.</p>
  <p>&bull; &nbsp; GPS systems use algorithms to find the shortest route to your destination.</p>
  <p>&bull; &nbsp; Even basic things like undo and redo in apps use stacks!</p>

  <h3>Course Learning Reflections</h3>
  <h4>1.Iteration Problems</h4>
  <h5>Examples in nature</h5>
  <p>Iteration means repeating steps in a loop until the job is done.</p>
  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Iteration means repeating steps in a loop until the job is done.</p>
  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Examples in Nature:</p>
  <h5>Examples in coding</h5>
  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Think of the sun rising and setting every day—it’s a repeating cycle.</p>
  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Counting the rings on a tree to know its age—each ring is added one at a time over the years.</p>
  <h3>2.Recursion Problems</h3>
  <h5>Examples in nature</h5>
  <p>Recursion is when a problem solves itself in smaller steps until it’s complete.</p>
  <h5>Examples in nature</h5>
  <p>Imagine a tree: A branch splits into smaller branches, which split into even smaller branches.</p>
  <p>Think of how you fold a piece of paper in half repeatedly—it’s the same process over and over.</p>
  <h5>Examples in coding</h5>
  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Calculating factorials.</p>
  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Finding your way through a family tree or exploring nested folders on your computer.</p>
